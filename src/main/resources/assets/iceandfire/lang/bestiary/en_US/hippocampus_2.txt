Hippocampi can be made to
sit by interacting with them
whilst holding a stick.





If killed, a hippocampi drops
shiny scales.

These shiny scales can be used
to craft mysterious potions that
grant water breathing.











The more scales used in the
process, the longer the
potion's effect will last.
