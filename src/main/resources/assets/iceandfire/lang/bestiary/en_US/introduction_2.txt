    Once a lectern has been placed,
it can be interacted with by
clicking on it. The inside will
have three slots, the leftmost
for bestiaries, the bottom for
manuscripts, and the leftmost
for output bestiaries. For
every three manuscripts, a new
page will apear in the index
of the bestiary. These new
pages can range from
information about mythical
creatures, different types
of peoples, informitave
crafting guides, and even
 basic alchemy.
